## Electron Development Instructions

Unlike the Android and Apple clients, the Windows and Linux clients use the Electron framework, rather than Cordova.

You will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed to build the Electron clients.

> If you can't use Docker, you can use [podman](https://podman.io) as substitute by running the following (for macOS):

```sh
brew install podman
podman machine init
sudo ln -s $(which podman) /usr/local/bin/docker
sudo /opt/homebrew/Cellar/podman/<podman version>/bin/podman-mac-helper install
podman machine set --rootful podman-machine-default
podman machine start
```

To build the Electron clients, run (it will also package an installer executable into `build/dist`):

```sh
npm run action electron/build [windows|linux]
```

To run the Electron clients, run:

```sh
npm run action electron/start [windows|linux]
```

### Windows

To build the _release_ version of Windows installer, you'll also need:

- [Java 8+ Runtime](https://www.java.com/en/download/). This is required for the cross-platform Windows executable signing tool [Jsign](https://ebourg.github.io/jsign/). If you don't need to sign the executables, feel free to skip this.
